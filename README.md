# Pathfinding Starter Code


Derived Requirements
    
    - The Random Player will a randomly assigned path which:
        Starts at the start node
        Ends at the exit node
        Includes the target node as part of the path
    
    - The path shall be a valid traversal such that each sequential pair of nodes in the path are connected by an edge.

    - The player will not be able to go to exit node before they reach the target node

    - Add statistic to each player to show how many nodes the player visits before it reaches the exit node

    - Add tests to make sure there is a start, end, and target node in graph before it begins to search

    - Add tests to ensure the player stops at the end node

    - Add tests to ensure that it reaches the target node at some point during the player's turn
